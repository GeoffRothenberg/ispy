# ispy

ispy is our group's implementation of a file monitoring system. It uses the python library watchdog to monitor for specfic events in specfic files.


# Installation of Python 3 and Watchdog
ispy was written by our group to be run with Python 3. If not already installed, please download at https://www.python.org/downloads/. The minimum recomended version is 3.6.6
We do not preclude usage on Python 2 but we have written it with Python 3 in mind and all features will be available on that version. Our program also requires the library
watchdog. It is available for download freom the Python Package Index here: https://pypi.org/project/watchdog/
